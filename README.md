# User-Experience-Design
Design of user centered solution

# PROBLEM STATEMENT
Modern households face several challenges related to energy consumption, such as rising utility costs, environmental concerns, and the inefficiency of existing systems. Many homeowners are unaware of which appliances consume the most energy, leading to unnecessary expenses. Traditional energy bills provide limited insights, often showing only total consumption without details about specific appliances or time-of-use patterns. If it is possible to monitor and optimize energy usage, we can collectively reduce our carbon footprint. Addressing these issues through a solution provides significant benefits, including cost savings, environmental sustainability, and enhanced convenience.

# OBJECTIVE
To create a user-centered solution for a specific problem through a structured design process. This will enable learners to systematically apply principles learned at each stage, including user research, problem definition, ideation, prototyping, and testing.
